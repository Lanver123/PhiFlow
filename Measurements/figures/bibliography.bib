	abstract = {The chapter analyzes wave-type partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the transmission of neural signals and proposes filtering for estimating the spatiotemporal variations of voltage in the neurons’ membrane. It is shown that in specific neuron models the spatiotemporal variations of the membrane’s voltage follow PDEs of the wave type while in other models such variations are associated with the propagation of solitary waves in the membrane. To compute the dynamics of the membrane PDE model without knowledge of initial conditions and through the processing of noisy measurements, a new filtering method, under the name Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filtering, is proposed. The PDE of the membrane is decomposed into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with respect to time. Next, each one of the local models associated with the ordinary differential equations is transformed into a model of the linear canonical (Brunovsky) form through a change of coordinates (diffeomorphism) which is based on differential flatness theory. This transformation provides an extended model of the nonlinear dynamics of the membrane for which state estimation is possible by applying the standard Kalman Filter recursion. The proposed filtering method is tested through numerical simulation tests.},

	abstract = {Numerical weather prediction (NWP) is an initial-value problem for a system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in which the initial values are known only incompletely and inaccurately. Data at initial time can be supplemented, however, by observations of the system distributed over a time interval preceding it. Estimation theory has been successful in approaching such problems for models governed by systems of ordinary differential equations and of linear PDEs. We develop methods of sequential estimation for NWP.A model exhibiting many features of large-scale atmospheric flow important in NWP is the one governed by the shallow-fluid equations. We study first the estimation problem for a linearized version of these equations. The vector of observations corresponds to the different atmospheric quantities measured and space-time patterns associated with conventional and satellite-borne meteorological observing systems. A discrete Kalman-Bucy (K-B) filter is applied to a finite-difference version of the equations, which simulates the numerical models used in NWP.The specific character of the equations’ dynamics gives rise to the necessity of modifying the usual K-B filter. The modification consists in eliminating the high-frequency inertia-gravity waves which would otherwise be generated by the insertion of observational data. The modified filtering procedure developed here combines in an optimal way dynamic initialization (i.e., elimination of fast waves) and four-dimensional (space-time) assimilation of observational data, two procedures which traditionally have been carried out separately in NWP. Comparisons between the modified filter and the standard K-B filter have been made.The matrix of weighting coefficients, or filter, applied to the observational corrections of state variables converges rapidly to an asymptotic, constant matrix. Using realistic values of observational noise and system noise, this convergence has been shown to occur in numerical experiments with the linear system studied; it has also been analyzed theoretically in a simplified, scalar case. The relatively rapid convergence of the filter in our simulations leads us to expect that the filter will be efficiently computable for operational NWP models and real observation patterns.Our program calls for the study of the asymptotic filter’s dependence on observation patterns, noise levels, and the system’s dynamics. Furthermore, the covariance matrices of system noise and observational noise will be determined from the data themselves in the process of sequential estimation, rather than be assigned predetermined, heuristic values. Finally, the estimation procedure will be extended to the full, nonlinear shallow-fluid equations.},
